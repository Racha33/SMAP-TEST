FULL stack challenge:


Inside the dashboard file we have the consumption app and the data stored.

This webpage contains three pages:
- The homepage: Contains instructions for the challenge.
- The summary: Contains data about the total consumption for all the users, as well as the detail tariffs and area of these users.
- Detail view: Takes in a user ID and return a consumption graph in terms of days. 

Also in this challenge we can implement the command in  `dashboard/consumption/management/commands/import.py`
to import user data from the terminal line. 


Front end challenge:
- I managed to only make one page: Creating a reusable Vue component for displaying a list of consumers and filtering by consumer types. There should be options of deleting and adding consumers.
I added an edit option but it doesn't work. 

- I did not creat my own css and html styling I used bootsrap instead.
